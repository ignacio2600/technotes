# Tech Notes

**Exploring systems, scripting, and projects**

Welcome to **Tech Notes**, my personal space for documenting technology experiments, tutorials, and projects.  
This site is built with **GitHub Pages** and serves both as a blog and a portfolio of the work I’ve done.

## What You’ll Find Here
- 🖥️ Operating system installs and configurations  
- ⚙️ Shell scripting and automation  
- 🗄️ Databases and data handling  
- 💻 Personal projects and experiments  

## Purpose
I use Tech Notes to:
- Document what I’m learning and building  
- Share tutorials and guides that may help others  
- Showcase projects for prospective employers and collaborators
